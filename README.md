A Quick NYC Airbnb Analysis and App Demo Basic on Streamlit
Deployed on heroku and visit it on https://nyc-airbnb-analysis.herokuapp.com/
This project has contributed to Streamlit gallery.

## Overview
It contains two-part:

1.Basic data exploration of NYC airbnb dataset. Since this dataset has been explored and investigated by a lot of people, I won't dive deep into it, just some basic EDA plots.

2.An **interactive** example Airbnb search filter basic on Streamlit. You can select an Airbnb house basic on different price, boroughs and room types

The dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data
